UX AND UI PROJECT

Paper Prototype

WIREFRAMES

William option - See Wire-frame-1

Michael option - See Wire-frame-2
I decided to focus on perceived affordance making it simple for the user to figure what 
a button function is the visible constraints werent really focused on as there is no 
user input in the form of text. However the consistency is rather lacking as color for titles 
are different however the return to homepage,sound,diffculty and pay buttons are all consistnat. 

Wire-frame-2 was the final wire frame chosen

Changes based on feedback 
-----------------------------
- Based hint point system to allow for diffculty scaling as well as a display for the 
currently avilable points (user affordance improvements)

- Allows users to visually see list of letter already used (User affordance improvements)

- Add colour to buttons,titles and for background (colour theory)
